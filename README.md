## Purpose
This project is set up to map bacteria from provided samples in search for a new species to cultivate a synthetic beef. We have the demographic information from the volunteers. This dashboard maps the top ten bacteria found in the volunteer's navel, the frequency of washing of the navel, and the concentration of samples found per sample.
